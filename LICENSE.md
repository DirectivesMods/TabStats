   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute
     this software, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any
     purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

  1. Seriously, we don't care. Use it, abuse it, sell it, eat it for 
     breakfast if that's your thing. We're not your mom.

  2. If this code breaks your computer, summons demons, or causes your
     coffee to taste weird, that's on you buddy. We ain't liable for 
     squat.

  3. Want to claim you wrote this? Go ahead, we probably stole half of
     it from Stack Overflow anyway. The circle of code continues.

  4. This software comes with absolutely no tech support. Do not email us
     asking why it doesn't work on your toaster. It's a feature, not a bug.

  5. If you make millions from this code, buying the original authors
     a beer would be nice, but it's not required. We'll settle for a
     GitHub star and maybe a mildly amusing meme.

 IF IT DOESN'T WORK, TRY TURNING IT OFF AND ON AGAIN. IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,
 MAYBE TRY SOMETHING ELSE. IF THAT STILL DOESN'T WORK, TOUGH SHIT.
